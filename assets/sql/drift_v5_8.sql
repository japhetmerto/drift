It’s time to Let Loose.', '<img src=\"assets/img/bg/dirt5_1.jpg\" alt=\"dirt5 pic\" width=\"660\" height=\"371\"> <br><br>\r\nAs revealed during Microsoft’s Inside Xbox show, Codemasters is delighted to announce DIRT 5, launching from October 2020 on Xbox Series X, PlayStation® 5, Windows PC (via Steam) and the current generation of Xbox and PlayStation consoles. A Google Stadia version will be released in early 2021.<br><br>\r\n\r\nWhilst respecting the heritage and retaining the DNA of the franchise, DIRT 5 writes a new chapter in the legacy of DIRT – bolder and braver than ever before. Check out the official announce trailer, soundtracked by the superb ‘Time to Dance (Sebastian Remix)’ by The Shoes:<br><br>\r\n\r\nDIRT 5 is more than relentless rallying, more than suspension-shaking jumps, more than hairpins and handbrakes. Join an energised world of off-road racing, and be part of a vibe that delivers big on epic action, pure expression, and unbridled style.<br><br>\r\n\r\nNow, time for some juicy info…<br><br>\r\n\r\nBursting with modes, ways to play, and concepts never before seen in the series, DIRT 5 is an overload of amplified entertainment.<br><br>\r\n\r\nDive into the ambitious Career mode, which lets you choose your path to glory as you progress through an immersive journey. The narrative features a voice cast led by the legendary Troy Baker and Nolan North, partnered by the car culture heroes at Donut Media and more famous names from the automotive world. Make your unique mark and overcome all obstacles to ensure nobody ever forgets your name.<br><br>\r\n\r\nPlay together in Career and offline modes with split-screen for up to four players, making DIRT 5 the ultimate playground for you to throw down, trade paint and get really sideways with your friends, either online or on the couch.<br><br>\r\n\r\nLooking for a fresh way to be playful on four wheels? Take the fun to a global scene, with traditional race events and innovative modes that’ll have you hooning for miles and grinning from ear to ear. But that’s far from all it when it comes to ways to play DIRT 5. Look out for the reveal of a new mode later this year – something you have never seen before from the DIRT franchise.<br><br>\r\n\r\nTravel the world to conquer over 70 routes from locations spanning the entire globe, that turn real landmarks into racetracks – from the frozen East River in New York, to the marble mines of Italy, to the Favelas of Brazil. Defy dynamic weather conditions, intimidating terrain and unpredictable elements in eight different race types, covering gravel, snow, mud, ice and more surfaces in between.<br><br>\r\n\r\nYour ride of choice? Choose from a ferocious car roster that includes machines purpose-built for off-road dominance – and a few you’ll be less used to seeing off the beaten track. Our first trailer gives you a first glimpse at what you’ll take the wheel of, from extreme machines like the Ariel Nomad, to racing icons like the Lancia Stratos and modern off-road masters like the Citroen C3 R5.<br><br>\r\n\r\nOh, and each car will be visually customisable through DIRT 5’s nuanced livery editor, with more editing options than any previous DIRT game. Once you’re done designing, snap your greatest moments with a dedicated Photo Mode, capturing ever jump, scrape and slide.<br><br>\r\n\r\nIt’s all set in that amplified off-road world, dripping in style and giving license for you to express yourself, on and off the track. With a backdrop of infectious atmosphere and an unforgettable soundtrack, everything you do in DIRT 5 adds to the vibe. So, what will you bring to the table?<br><br>\r\n\r\nLaunching on the new generation of consoles, as well as current-gen, DIRT 5 makes use of the groundbreaking technology coming to console gaming. With Xbox Series X, experience heightened graphical fidelity in a hyperreal world, optimised performance no matter the mode, and unparalleled load-times for constant action.<br><br>\r\n\r\nWith Xbox Smart Delivery, if you purchase the Xbox One version of DIRT 5, you’ll receive the best version of it to your Xbox One, as usual. Then, if you decide to jump into the next generation with Xbox Series X, you will automatically receive the Xbox Series X optimized version of at no additional cost.<br><br>\r\n\r\nBe the focus. Be recognised. Be the one to take iconic environments, dangerous terrain and incredible vehicles, and turn them into highlight-reel moments. That’s what DIRT 5 is all about. Time to make it what you’re all about, too.<br><br>\r\n\r\nJoin the conversation and engage with the DIRT 5 team right now through the game’s official Discord server. Of course, follow the DiRT channels on Instagram, Twitter, Facebook and YouTube, where we’ll be showing you so much more of the game in the coming weeks and months – from feature deep dives, to art concepts, to peeling back the curtain on DIRT 5’s creation.', 'dirt5.jpg', '2020-11-01', 'Product Release'),

The album is titled All Out, featuring collaborations with other artists as well as a new group member in Seraphine. The group first released a single from the album in August, titled ‘The Baddest’. <br><br>\r\n\r\nAs promised, K/DA — the virtual K-pop group that’s part of the ever-expanding League of Legends universe — has its very first album on the way. Today, developer Riot revealed that the band’s first EP, titled All Out, will be out on November 6th. K/DA released its first single following a two-year hiatus back in August.<br><br>\r\n\r\nIf you’re wondering what any of that actually means, here’s a quick explainer: in 2018, the annual League of Legends World Championship opened with a stunning AR concert, which featured a K-pop group made up of both in-game characters and real-world pop stars. It was an intriguing mix that turned into a big hit, and now Riot is bringing the band back in a big way. In addition to the EP, there’s also an ongoing comic series and a TikTok-style dance competition. The band also got a new member through an elaborate reveal involving a virtual influencer.<br><br>\r\n\r\n <img src=\"assets/img/bg/kdat.jpg\" alt=\"KDA pic\" width=\"548\" height=\"520\"> <br><br>\r\n\r\nAlso of note: the 2020 edition of the World Championship is currently underway in Shanghai, with the finals slated for October 31st at the newly opened Pudong Football Stadium. The event is known for its striking opening ceremonies, which typically revolve around music; the 2018 K-pop event was followed by a holographic hip-hop concert last year. Given all of the recent announcements, it seems likely K/DA will be involved in this year’s event in some way — just in time to promote the album.<br><br>\r\n\r\n', 'kda.jpg', '2020-11-09', 'Announcements'),

Xbox head Phil Spencer tells The Verge that we may see a dedicated Xbox app for smart TVs by next year, one that could stream console games directly to screens using Microsoft’s Project xCloud service.<br><br>\r\n\r\nSpeaking with The Verge, Spencer said, “I think you’re going to see [an Xbox app for smart TVs] in the next 12 months. I don’t think anything is going to stop us from doing that. ... What we used to call a TV was a CRT that’s just throwing an image on the back of a piece of glass that I’m looking at. Now, as you said, a TV is really more of a game console stuffed behind a screen that has an app platform and a Bluetooth stack and a streaming capability. Is it really a TV anymore, or is it just the form and function of the devices that we used to have around our TV, consolidated into the one big screen that I’m looking at?”<br><br>\r\n\r\nSpencer added that “the amount of compute capability in my home has increased with the number of streaming signals that have come in, not decreased,” concluding, “I think gaming will be one of those things as well.”<br><br>\r\n\r\nMicrosoft’s Project xCloud service streams select Xbox games to mobile phones and tablets. Currently, the game-streaming service is restricted to Google’s Android platform, but a web-based version of xCloud streaming for iOS devices is also in the works. Project xCloud was recently added to the Ultimate tier of Microsoft’s Xbox Game Pass subscription service.<br><br>\r\n\r\nAs The Verge points out, Spencer also recently hinted at another hardware option for game streaming on TVs: “streaming sticks,” in the vein of Amazon’s Fire TV Stick. “You could imagine us even having something that we just included in the Game Pass subscription that gave you an ability to stream xCloud games to your television and buying the controller,” Spencer told Stratechery in an interview in late October.', 'xbox.jpg', '2020-11-24', 'Press Conference'),

R. Martin on Elden Ring, Hidetaka Miyazaki says he is calling on familiar influences for its gameplay. Speaking to IGN, Miyazaki explains that fans can expect to see elements of Dark Souls, and quite vividly too.<br><br>\r\n<img src=\"assets/img/bg/erp.jpg\" alt=\"er pic\" width=\"660\" height=\"371\"></b> <br><br>\r\n\r\n“Elden Ring is a third-person action RPG with a fantasy setting. Gameplay-wise, it’s heavily based on Dark Souls,” says Miyazaki. “However, that doesn’t mean that it plays out in the same way. With a more open and vast environment, the way combat plays out becomes fundamentally different.”<br><br>\r\n\r\nFromSoftware’s previous work in Dark Souls, Bloodborne, and Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice sees the developer use open style maps that are inspired by the Metroidvania genre. That means you can expect to revisit environments but interact with them in different ways – be it as a result of new abilities that let you explore new places, or a story beat that changes how it looks. As Miyazaki explains that Elden Ring’s environments are more vast and open, it could mean that we’ll revisit areas less and have even more places to explore too.<br><br>\r\n\r\nOne thing we won’t be seeing on our travels, however, is towns and NPCs. Though, Miyazaki does admit there will still be ruins of towns, much like his previous games.<br><br>\r\n\r\n“Creating a new type of game is a big challenge for us,” Miyazaki explains. “If we would add towns on top of that, it would become a bit too much, so we decided to create an open world style game focused on what we are best at.”<br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\nOne thing we will be coming across in Elden Ring, however, is difficult challenges to overcome. Speaking to Xbox this time, Miyazaki explains that maintaining that thrill of overcoming difficult challenges is an integral part of a FromSoftware game.<br><br>\r\n\r\n“The importance we place on the joy the player experiences through overcoming challenges will be the same as it is in our other titles,” He says. “I believe it will prove to be a very satisfying experience.”<br><br>\r\n\r\nE3 2019 is still rumbling on, and we’re covering it day and night.

Current-gen console players get all this and more as part of a free update - but none of it will be made available to PC players.<br><br>\r\n\r\nDuring a recent preview event attended by Eurogamer, representatives of EA Sports were asked why the PC version will be left behind with \"gen four\" features as PS5 and Xbox Series X and S gets \"gen five\" features.<br><br>\r\n   \r\n\r\nAre the PS5 and Xbox Series X too buggy at launch?<br><br>\r\n\r\nExecutive producer Aaron McHardy said EA took the decision to keep the PC minimum specs down, \"so that we can open the doors and be inclusive to everybody who wants to play FIFA.\"<br><br>\r\n\r\n\"When we looked at what generation to put the PC game on, we looked at our fans and what capabilities they had with the hardware they have,\" McHardy said.<br><br>\r\n\r\n\"And we have that information to understand what the power of the PCs out there in the world are. And when we looked at that, in order to run the gen five game, our min spec would have been at a spot that would have left a lot of people out in the cold not being able to play the game.<br><br>\r\n\r\n\"So we made the choice to keep the PC version of the game on the gen four version of FIFA so that we can open the doors and be inclusive to everybody who wants to play FIFA.\"<br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\nThe news likely won\'t go down well with FIFA 21 players who have PCs capable of these next-gen features, but may not come as much of a surprise, either. Back in June 2020, when it emerged EA had decided to make FIFA 21 on PC the same as the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One version without explanation, we speculated it was a business decision based on likely data that suggested the bulk of PC FIFA users were probably playing on an old, or medium-power PC, and the need to prioritise development resources.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"assets/img/bg/ea.jpg\" alt=\"ea pic\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\"> <br><br>\r\n\r\nFor reference, here are the FIFA 21 PC minimum specs:<br><br>\r\n\r\n    Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system<br>\r\n    OS: Windows 10 - 64-Bit<br>\r\n    Processor: Intel Core i3-6100 @ 3.7GHz or AMD Athlon X4 880K @4GHz<br>\r\n    Memory: 8GB RAM<br>\r\n    Graphics: NVIDIA GTX 660 2GB or AMD Radeon HD 7850 2GB<br>\r\n    Storage: 50 GB available space<br><br>\r\n\r\nIt\'s also worth noting that EA has done this before. FIFA on PC lagged behind the console versions when it came to features and even the game engine itself during the early years of the last decade. It wasn\'t until the release of FIFA 15 in 2014 that the PC version used all the EA Sports Ignite engine bells and whistles that were present on PS4 and Xbox One.<br><br>\r\n\r\nEven before then, for a number of years the PC version of the massive-selling series lacked the features found in the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 version, although parity was achieved with FIFA 12. Now, of course, all versions of FIFA use the Frostbite engine. When will PC catch up with PS5 and Xbox Series X? Perhaps PC gamers will have to wait until FIFA 2022 comes out next year.', 'fifa.jpg', '2020-11-24', 'Press Conference');
